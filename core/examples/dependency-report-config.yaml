# Example configuration file for multi-repository dependency reporting
# This file demonstrates how to configure DevDashboard to analyze dependencies
# across multiple repositories and generate a version comparison report.

providers:
  # GitHub configuration
  github:
    # Default values that apply to all repositories unless overridden
    default:
      # Authentication token (can also use environment variable)
      token: "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"

      # Default owner/organization
      owner: "python-poetry"

      # Default git reference (branch, tag, or commit)
      ref: "main"

      # Default paths to search for lock files (empty means search entire repo)
      paths: []

      # Default analyzer type (poetry, pipfile, uvlock)
      analyzer: "poetry"

      # Packages to track across repositories
      packages:
        - "requests"
        - "urllib3"
        - "pytest"
        - "black"
        - "mypy"

    # List of repositories to analyze
    repositories:
      # First repository - inherits all defaults
      - repository: "poetry"

      # Second repository - overrides some defaults
      - repository: "poetry-plugin-export"
        owner: "python-poetry"
        ref: "main"

      # Third repository - custom configuration
      - repository: "another-repo"
        owner: "different-org"
        ref: "develop"
        analyzer: "pipfile"
        paths:
          - "src"
          - "lib"
        packages:
          - "django"
          - "celery"
          - "redis"

  # GitLab configuration
  gitlab:
    default:
      token: "${GITLAB_TOKEN}"
      owner: "myorg"
      ref: "main"
      analyzer: "poetry"
      packages:
        - "requests"
        - "flask"
        - "sqlalchemy"

    repositories:
      - repository: "api-service"

      - repository: "worker-service"
        ref: "staging"

      - repository: "frontend-service"
        analyzer: "uvlock"
        packages:
          - "fastapi"
          - "pydantic"
          - "uvicorn"

# Additional examples:

# Using environment variables for sensitive data:
# token: "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"
# owner: "${REPO_OWNER}"

# Analyzing specific paths only:
# paths:
#   - "backend/services"
#   - "shared/common"

# Tracking different packages per repository:
# - repository: "repo1"
#   packages: ["package1", "package2"]
# - repository: "repo2"
#   packages: ["package3", "package4"]

# Using different analyzers:
# - repository: "poetry-project"
#   analyzer: "poetry"
# - repository: "pipenv-project"
#   analyzer: "pipfile"
# - repository: "uv-project"
#   analyzer: "uvlock"
